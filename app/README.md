### Key Components

#### SMS Service
- Monitors incoming SMS messages in foreground and background
- Identifies bank messages using sender address patterns
- Parses transaction details using regex patterns
- Updates account balances automatically
- Stores transactions in local database

#### Local Server
- Built with Shelf framework
- Serves REST API endpoints for web frontend
- Provides endpoints for:
  - Accounts (`/api/accounts`)
  - Transactions (`/api/transactions`)
  - Banks (`/api/banks`)
  - Summary (`/api/summary`)
  - Analytics (`/api/analytics/*`)

#### Database
- SQLite database for local storage
- Tables: accounts, transactions, failed_parses
- Automatic migrations for schema updates

## API Documentation

## Troubleshooting

### SMS Not Being Detected

1. Ensure SMS permissions are granted
2. Check that the sender address matches bank codes in `lib/data/consts.dart`
3. View failed parses in the debug dialog to see what's happening

### Account Balance Not Updating

1. Verify the account number matches the one in SMS messages
2. Check that SMS parsing patterns are correct for your bank
3. Some banks may require different account matching logic

### Web Server Not Starting

1. Ensure your device and computer are on the same network
2. Check firewall settings
3. Verify the IP address displayed in the Web tab
